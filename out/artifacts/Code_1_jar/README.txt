to run jar file:
-type "cmd" in current address bar of Windows file explorer
-paste command found in COMMAND.txt into cmd

terminal shows coordinates of atoms and ray paths, though refer to board_planner.png for a visual representation, 
this is all based on seed(1), seed will be random in final state of game, but this can be used as a testing basis

SCALE button is temporary, is a planned extra feature (not included in sprints, just better compatibility for 
smaller screens), right now scales other than default do not work, but the button is ALWAYS in top left so if you 
keep clicking you can still eventually cycle back to default scale, so the game will not get soft-locked if you 
accidentally click it

GUESS ATOMS is planned for next sprint, right now its a button just to end the game

Have fun! :)
